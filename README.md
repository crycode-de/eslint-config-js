# ESLint config

This modules provides an ESLint configuration to be used with **plain JavaScript**
according to my personal preferences.

## Usage

Add `eslint` and `@crycode/eslint-config-js` to your devDependencies:

```shell
npm install --save-dev eslint @crycode/eslint-config-js
```

Add a file named `.eslintrc.js` to your project root directory:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    '@crycode/eslint-config-js',
  ],
};
```
